    label: "Why do we sell the application instead of making money ourselves?",
    body: `At first, we made the application for ourselves after four years of hard work. In 2020, we started using it and shared it with our friends. As time went on and our income stayed the same, and more people started using wallets worldwide, we saw the chance to help others earn money too. So, we decided to sell the application. It's been a journey of hard work and dedication, making sure everyone has a chance to make money while keeping our own income stable.`,

  {
    label: "What guarantees?",
    body: `We can't promise you'll uncover 10 bitcoins or recoup the application's cost in a single day. But here's what we can guarantee: If you don't find the wallets within a week, we'll gladly refund your investment. That's our commitment to you.`,
  },
  {
    label: "Is it legal?",
    body: `Given that most wallets are likely old and forgotten by their owners, we view it from a legal standpoint. It's like searching for lost jewelry on the beach with a metal detector. Just as no one thinks that's illegal, we feel the same way about this! Over the past four years, neither we nor our clients have encountered any issues.`,
  },
  {
    label: "Does it make any difference which country I am in?",
    body: `Of course not. You can use the app from any country, anywhere in the world.`,
  },
  {
    label: "Can I install it on my phone?",
    body: `Our application works on every device you can think of, like iPhones, Macs, Windows PCs, and Android phones. No matter what gadget you're using, our application will run smoothly and do its job well.`,
  },
  {
    label: "Money out of thin air?",
    body: `For us, this has been one of the hardest jobs, with so many hours spent fixing problems, writing code, and more over the last four years. We've worked late into the night, spending many sleepless nights staring at the screen. It's been a huge amount of work!`,
  },
  {
    label: "Give me the app, I'll pay you a percent of the profits?",
    body: `Guys, let's get real here. It's not how things work. When you buy a laptop or computer for work, you don't ask the seller to give it to you for free, then promise to pay them back once you start making money. It's just not the way it goes. Similarly, with the application, we can't control how you use it after you've bought it. Whether you end up using it regularly or forget about it.`,
  },
  {
    label: "Do I need a powerful device for the application?",
    body: `Of course not. Our application operates entirely through our servers, which have dependable hardware. So, there's no need to stress about it. You can start earning from any device you have.`,
  },
  {
    label: "How much a day will I earn?",
    body: `Every experience is unique. There are days when we find nothing at all, maybe even a few days of quiet. Then there are days when we discover 5-10 wallets in a single day. It's important to know that we have a guarantee system, so we're confident that you can earn money. Still have questions? Write to us @lostmining and we will answer any question you have about our application.`,
